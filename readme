# Screenshot and Text Extraction using Selenium

This script captures a screenshot of a webpage and extracts its text using Selenium and clipboard operations.

## Features

- Captures a full-page screenshot.
- Extracts text content from the webpage.
- Uses Selenium for browser automation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Chrome WebDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

For Windows:

```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have `pip` updated:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Notes

- The script waits for the page to load before capturing text.
- It simulates `Ctrl + A` and `Ctrl + C` to copy text from the page.
- The extracted text is stored in the clipboard and printed in the console.
- You can modify the script to store extracted text in a file.
